	/// Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA). Developed by Patrick Mulloy and introduced 
	/// in the February 1994 issue of Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine.
	/// DEMA was designed to lessen the lag of a regular exponential moving average. 
	/// It is a composite of a single exponential MA and a double exponential MA that 
	/// produces less lag than its two components individually.
